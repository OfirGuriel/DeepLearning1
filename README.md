# DeepLearning1

This repository contains the notebooks of the first assignment in Deep Learing for Computational Vision Applications. Each notebook is independent of the other, 
and were all written and run in Google Colab.

# Running Instructions
In order to run the notebooks, copy them to your drive.
Make sure you have the folder chest_xray on your drive, and it is divided into 3 sub-folders (train, validation and test), and each one is divided to the 2 labels: 'NORMAL' and 'PNEUMONIA'.
